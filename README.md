# Temperature-Based Fan Speed Controller

## Overview
An IoT-based system that automatically controls fan speed based on surrounding temperature.

## Features
- Automatic temperature detection
- PWM-based fan speed control
- Energy-efficient operation

## Tech Stack
- Arduino / ESP32
- Temperature Sensor (DHT11 / LM35)
- Embedded C

## Results
- Maintained temperature within ±2°C
- Reduced power consumption by ~10–12%

## Future Improvements
- IoT cloud integration
- Mobile app monitoring
